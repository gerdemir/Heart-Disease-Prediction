# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, and other health indicators. 
The model is trained using supervised machine learning algorithms.
The same model was deployed with Streamlit for an interactive web application, the Multi-Disease Prediction Project.

Features
Machine learning model(Logistic Regression) trained on a heart disease dataset.
To save the trained model, "pickle" was used.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset.
